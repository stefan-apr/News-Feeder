#News-Feeder

This application is designed to display and allow users to leave comments on articles from Kiro 7's Local News section. These articles
are hosted on Kiro 7's webpage here: https://www.kiro7.com/news

The user can use the "Scrape" button to gather up new articles, and can save any articles they wish. Once an article
is saved, users can leave notes on them on the "Saved Article" page. Notes are persistent and will appear to all users
who navigate to that article in their "Saved Articles" page. Notes can also be deleted if the user would like.

There is currently no login system, so all users can view and edit others' notes. A user account system may be added if time permits.

This application was developed using Node JS, MongoDB, Handlebars, and is published using Heroku at https://obscure-brushlands-59312.herokuapp.com/
